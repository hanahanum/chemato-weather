# :seedling: API Precision Model of Cherry Tomato's Condition by Weather Using Neural Network :cloud:

This is an API for model precision of Cherry Tomato's condition by using weather data at BBPP Lembang, Bandung, Indonesia, which used IoT systems to collect the dataset. Its size was 800 rows, and it's already cleaned. The accuracy of the model is 0.98% using three data columns: lux, temperature, and humidity.

For this API, I used the following library:
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
- [flasgger](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger)
- [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)

You can run this API using Docker for the deployment. Feel free to try! :smile:
